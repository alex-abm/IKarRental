#IKarRental

The iKarRental project is a PHP-based web application designed for a car rental service, allowing users to browse, filter, and book available cars. Guest users can view listings with details such as brand, model, transmission type, passenger capacity, and daily price but must register and log in to make reservations. Registered users can book cars for specific dates, with a confirmation page displaying booking details and the total cost, while unsuccessful bookings display an error message. The platform features a user authentication system, including registration, login, and a profile page that shows past reservations. An administrator portal allows the management of car listings, including adding, editing, and deleting vehicles, as well as viewing and managing all bookings. The homepage includes advanced filtering options such as availability, transmission type, seating capacity, and price range. The system ensures proper error handling and data validation while maintaining a polished, mobile-friendly design. Advanced features include a calendar-based booking system that prevents overlapping reservations and an AJAX-powered booking confirmation modal for a seamless user experience. The project must be developed without external PHP frameworks, with all necessary files included in a structured format for submission by the deadline.
